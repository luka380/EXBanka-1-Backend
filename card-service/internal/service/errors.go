// Package service: typed sentinel errors for card-service operations.
//
// Each sentinel embeds a gRPC code via svcerr.SentinelError. Wrapping it
// with fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err, sentinel) preserves the code through
// status.FromError. Handlers therefore become passthrough — no
// string-matching is required to map service errors back to gRPC status.
